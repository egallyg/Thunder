# Thunder
Created 2017/2018 by Erik Gallagher

This program integrates with a specialized combination of a Raspberry Pi and LED Strips.
The apparatus is made mobile through use of a battery pack and PCB.
The program provides methods for making and storing events through the LED strips,
able to be played back in sequence as a light show.
The intent is to then synchronize this light show to music for cosplay or performance art purposes.
